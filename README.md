jib
===

Jib is a super simple dependency downloader for Java.

Just define your dependencies in a package.json file and run 'jib'.

Available dependencies can found at 'http://search.maven.org/'.

Instead of putting a specific version of a dependency in the config you can just use 'latest' or 'release'.
